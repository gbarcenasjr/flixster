### Notes
When I was setting up the collection view, I didn't modify the estimate size of my collection view! I went around in the code and the main.storyboard only to find the solution in the Assigment 2 instructions. However, because of this, I was able to write a missing identifier.

### Notes
There was some initial issue with the "pod install" feature, due to using an M1 BigSur Macbook. Luckily, Angela Dimon, a CodePath TA, was able to help me with this issue and pointed me to an article that solved the problem.
